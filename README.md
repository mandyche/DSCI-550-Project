Exploring the Impact of Remote Work on Employee Performance and Satisfaction

Project idea:
As companies encourage employees to return to the office post-pandemic [3], understanding the
effects of remote work on employee satisfaction and performance is crucial. Flexible work
arrangements have been shown to impact worker well-being and productivity [4]. This project
will analyze how varying remote work arrangements influence employee performance,
satisfaction, and retention within a corporate environment. We will categorize employees into
high, mid, and low performers [2] to explore the intersection of remote work frequency and job
satisfaction within each group.

Our specific research questions specifically include:
● Do high-performing employees report higher satisfaction levels with increased remote work as observed in previous findings by [1]?
● What percentage of low performers primarily work remotely, and does remote work impact their productivity?
● How does remote work frequency vary across performance categories (high, mid, low), and how does this influence retention?

Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/employee-performance-and-productivity-data

Content: A corporate employee performance dataset consisting of 100,000 rows and 18
columns. The dataset includes variables such as employee demographics (age, gender, education
level), job details (department, job title, salary), work habits (work hours per week, remote work
frequency, overtime hours), and performance indicators (performance score, projects handled,
satisfaction score, promotions, resignations).

Appropriateness: This dataset is comprehensive and allows us to analyze the
relationship between remote work, productivity, and job satisfaction. Its size is suitable for
statistical analysis and predictive modeling, making it ideal for our objectives.
